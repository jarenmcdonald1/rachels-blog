### NUT BUTTER & CHOCOLATE OAT BITES

<br>

- - -

<br>

I know we are in some strange times, but **I feel busier than ever**…anyone else?
<br>
I’ve been experimenting with higher protein snacks that will keep me feeling more sustained for longer while giving me enough of an energy burst to make it through these busy days.

##### Over Snacking and Protein

<br>

- - -

<br>

Do you ever eat a snack, a treat, a meal and not even feel slightly satiated? 
<br>

This happens to me…more often than I’d like to admit. Then what tends to happen is I end up eating too much empty food, which doesn't make me feel full, energized, and ready to face a busy day.

<br>

I started thinking, why is this happening, and what can I do about it?

<br>

Then it dawned on me. My snacks that were supposed to take me from meal to meal were missing something that would keep me feeling far more sustained and energetic.

###### PROTEIN!

<br>

- - -

<br>

I know as a plant-based eater that **protein is important**, and I focus on getting adequate protein at mealtimes, but I was forgetting about the importance of protein in snacks as well. 

<br>

**I want to snack smart, and not snack mindlessly**, which I think is a goal for most of us. Eating less often but eating enough smart foods to keep my mental and physical levels high without crashing mid-day. **Protein will aid in helping you feel full longer, as well as stabilize blood sugar levels to prevent a quick rise and fast fall, unlike a lot of other foods.**

<br>

Today, I’m going to share a wonderfully quick and easy recipe that will provide a good amount of protein, all while being a tasty treat that fuels my day.
