## NATURAL WAYS TO IMPLEMENT PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE

<br>

<br>

Have you grown tired of hearing about the Immune System yet?

With all that we have been through this year one thing that has become abundantly clear to me, is that preventative health care is essential.

#### WHAT IS PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE?

<br>

Preventative health care is exactly what it sounds like. **Preventing illness**, by taking steps to ensure you are ready for whatever life may throw at you.

<br>

With the year we have all had, the isolation, and over-cleaning, we have not been putting our immune system through its normal turbulent exposures throughout regular life.

<br>

Without constant exposure and the state of readiness our immune systems rest in, we are far more susceptible to smaller and larger illnesses.

<br>

For these reasons, it is important to do all we can to make sure our systems are set up for success and prepped for whatever might get tossed our way, and as we all know, none of us can predict what the future holds.

## NATURAL WAYS TO INCREASE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION

<br>

- - -

<br>

**First up,**

<br>

#### ZINC

<br>

Zinc is a big supporter of a number of functions in the body.
<br>

Today, however, we are talking about **Immune Health.**
<br>

Zinc is important for **regular development of illness fighting organisms** within the body such as **neutrophils, natural killer cells, and macrophages.** All of which are crucial for targeting infectious agents that try to invade the body, and ridding of them before they can do any serious damage.

<br>

**Foods rich in Zinc:**

<br>

Lentils

Eggs

Brazil Nuts

Chickpeas

<br>

I personally, love supplementation for the ease of ensuring I am getting enough of each important variety of vitamins/mineral daily.

<br>

If you have questions about specific dosages for supplementation, **please send me a message** at [hello@rmdholistics.com](mailto:hello@rmdholistics.com)

<br>

**Next,**

<br>

#### VITAMIN D

<br>

Vitamin D is another big player, important for a lot of purposes within the body, including **bone health, muscle health, mood balancing, heart health, and of course immunity.**
<br>

Known as a **protector of immune system function, as well as a protector against viral infections**. Vitamin D **lessens the damaging response of some white blood cells that are used to fight infection**, while Vitamin D also **boosts immune cells production of microbe-fighting proteins**.
<br>
Vitamin D **enhances the pathogen fighters effectiveness, and helps to more successfully rid of illness**.
<br>
Vitamin D is also known as an **anti-inflammatory** which decreases inflammation within the body which helps for systems to run more efficiently, and effectively.
<br>

This makes it vital in the way of being prepared and having your body well equipped to face pathogens.

<br>

**Foods rich in Vitamin D:**

<br>

Eggs

Fish

Mushrooms

<br>

Same as above, supplementation is key, especially for Vitamin D, where it is very difficult to acquire enough through the diet.

<br>

**The final big player,**

<br>

#### VITAMIN C

<br>

Vitamin C supports many immune cells functions and **increases their natural ability to protect the body against infection**. It is also important for **sweeping away old cells and replacing it with brand new cells**. Out with the old, and in with the new!
<br>
Vitamin C is also a **powerful antioxidant, protecting the cells from free-radical damage**, which can negatively affect immune system function.

<br>

**Foods rich in Vitamin C:**

<br>

Sweet Yellow Peppers

Kale

Kiwi

Broccoli

Lemons

Strawberries

<br>

### NOTABLE MENTIONS

<br>

- - -

<br>

###### ELDERBERRY
<br>

Elderberry is a potent **antibacterial agent** that fights against bacterial pathogens, primarily responsible for **upper respiratory tract infections** and strains of the flu virus.

It is safe for children, and works to improve immune system response and **shorten the duration and intensity of colds, and viral infections**.

<br>

###### SELENIUM
<br>

Selenium is a mineral also known to **promote immune health**, by supporting systems that are included in improving the **effectiveness of immunity**.

<br>

###### B-COMPLEX
<br>

B Vitamins are known to help sort out where the Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins are needed to be useful for the body. Specifically, **B12, and B6 are important for immune health by creating new red blood cells**, which help deliver oxygen, as well as delivering important vitamins and minerals throughout the body.

<br>

**Preventative Health Care** will help ensure you are ready for whatever way the cards are dealt. Being prepared and keeping your body in a place where your immune system is functioning optimally will lessen last-minute strain on your body and help keep you strong and powerful.

<br>

More on immunity to come, so stay tuned.

<br>

**Stay well, everyone!**
