Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry sleep on keyboard, for stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring , or where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Lick the curtain just to be annoying i will ruin the couch with my claws  grass smells good or eat half my food and ask for more and eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner  munch on tasty moths.
