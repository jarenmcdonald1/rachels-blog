Okay, so I know we all think we know what our immune system does...right?

<br>

I'm sure you know that it fight **illness** and **disease** off to ensure your body remains at an optimal functional level. However, the process is far more complicated than that. 

<br>

Our bodies synthesize and make proteins called **antibodies** that have the sole purpose of destroying abnormal or foreign cells, such as; bacteria, viruses, microbes, and toxins. They help to fight off common ailments like the flu or a cold, and they protect us all from major illnesses such as cancer or heart disease. 

These **antibodies** are our first line of defense and are called upon first to fight any battles to keep us safe. 

<br>

We also have a backup response known as the **"cell-mediated system."** This backup system utilizes **immune cells** rather than antibodies. These immune cells help your body create memories of past defense methods against specific threats.

This makes it possible for the body to recognize a repeat invader and use the defense method that had destroyed that same threat again before disease develops. 

<br>

#### THE GOOD NEWS & THE BAD NEWS

<br>

The beautiful part about your immune system is that it is heavily influenced by the way we treat our bodies. If we tend to have good healthy habits, and nourish ourselves properly, our immune systems become strong. But, on the other hand, if we don't practice healthy habits it is common to see individuals who become sick or ill often. This is a clear indication that their immune system is not functioning properly. 

This is good news for most as it is something we have a great deal of control over!

<br>

Some factors that heavily impact the immune system;

<br>

1. **SLEEP** 

   We have always been told how important our sleep is, another reason why this is true, is your immune system does a great deal of destruction of pathogens while we are resting. 

   Studies show that T-cells in particular become very active while we rest. T-cells are a type of immune cell that is responsible for latching on and destroying pathogens such as viruses, flu, and even cancer. 

   While we rest it gives our bodies time to assess danger and prevent any threats from creating any damage. 

   <br>


2. **STRESS**

   Ongoing stress makes us all more susceptible to illness and disease, as the brain reacts to stressors by sending a defense signal to the endocrine system. This raises the cortisol levels (fight or flight response), along with an array of other hormones that prepares us for emergency situations but also severeley decreases immune system function at the same time. 

   Finding methods such as meditation, deep breathing, exercising, journaling, etc that calm us in times of stress is vital to keep the immune system functioning at optimal levels. 

   <br>
3. **EXERCISE**

   Like with the rest of the points we know these are all important things that we should be doing, without knowing specifically why, or how it helps.

   When you engage in any kind of physical activity that gets your heart rate up for a sustained amount of time, for example, a 30-minute brisk walk or jog, a bike ride, or even some tennis volleying, your body senses it as a type of physiological stressor. As a result of this stressor, it deploys certain types of white blood cells like neutrophils and lymphocytes (particularly T-cells and natural killer cells) from different parts of your body to flood your bloodstream.

   This will allow the T-cells and natural killer cells to deploy and target any invaders that could be lurking around the body.

   Another mentionable aspect of exercise is, it works wonders for stress. It allows for a natural rise and fall in stress hormones, plus it leaves you with an abundance of serotonin (the happy hormone), to help you ease stress, and boost overall feelings of wellness.

4. **DIET RICH IN VITAMINS AND MINERALS**

   Lastly, a diet rich in an abundance of micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals increases overall immune system function. 

   As a nutritionist, I always recommend as I like to say **"eating the rainbow**" meaning, you are eating a variety of fruits and vegetables that range in colour. This is because each colour profile becomes rich in a certain type of micronutrient, vitamin, and mineral. In order to make sure we are always getting a variety and not only getting a few fro the list ensure we have a colourful diet, can make a huge difference. 

   When speaking specifically about immunity three micronutrients stick out as extremely beneficial;

   <br>

   **VITAMIN C**

   * Vitamin C stimulates the body's defense mechanisms against specific invaders. It also decreases inflammation which makes more room for free-flowing cells to pass through and heal the body. 
   * Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, meaning it targets and eliminates free radicals that can cause damage to your body.

     <br>

   **VITAMIN D**

   * Deficiencies in Vitamin D can lead to a suppressed immune system and immune system function.
   * One of the main functions of Vitamin D is to activate the T-cells [](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100307215534.htm)aka the "killer cells" in the body. T cells actually detect and destroy foreign pathogens, like viruses.
