Peaches are so yummy, fresh, and in-season here in Ontario for the summer. This makes them the ultimate choice for any sweet or savoury dishes throughout the summer. 

<br>

Packed with dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, and antioxidants, these sweet treats are an awesome addition to any creation. 

<br>
For me, I wanted to create a fun way to enjoy the sweetness in the morning without getting a sugar crash a little later on.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, breakfast isn't my favourite meal, but the more I look for in season and fresh ingredients to add to my breakfast the more I appreciate breakfast and all it's benefits throughout my day.
