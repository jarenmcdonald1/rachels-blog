            <Card.Text>My whole life I have been interested in health and wellness. The passion was handed down from my mom who would send me to school with Chlorophyll water (thanks, mom!). While I was completing my Professional Intense Dance Training program I began to experience digestive issues. I would curl up into a little ball with intense abdominal pain! With no clear answer, I tried to eliminate some known allergens. I noticed an immediate improvement in heightened energy levels and stronger body. This allowed me to push my body technically and physically which took my performance to the next level.</Card.Text>
            <Card.Text>From there my passion for nutrition took the centre stage. I decided to attend The Institute of Holistic Nutrition where I would deep dive into all things health-related. I graduated and gained my Certified Nutritional Practitioner Certification (CNP, Hons.)</Card.Text>
