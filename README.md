### About the site

This is a business site meant to attract potential clients and existing customers to my services. I use the blog to post updates and stories that keep users coming back for more content!

### Improvements

Using GatsbyJS has drastically improved the overall site speed and page-to-page loading speed. With Google Page Speed Insights I am consistently getting above 80 on mobile speeds and above 95 on desktop speeds. 

GatsbyJS also provides built-in SEO improvements which are very noticeable on Google's search engine!

### Tools used to develop:

- Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, Media Encoder
- HTML5, CSS, SASS, Git, JavaScript, React, GatsbyJS, GraphQL
- Netlify CMS, React Bootstrap
